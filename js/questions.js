Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) The ability to perceive form in three dimensions is something most people fully develop'."

Mechanical power can be transmitted for hundreds of miles, men can communicate almost instantaneously by telephone, the chiefs of great organisations can be transported by airplanes, the cinemas can produce plays in every village, music, speeches, and sermons can be broadcast'.  Hence, the correct answer is 'B) The need for cities to be close to manufacturing and business centres has diminished due to advances in technology'."

        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionA_PassageII.png",
        explanation: "The opening two sentences hint at 'A) threatening' being the correct answer: 'Each civilization is born, it culminates, and it decays. There is a widespread testimony that this ominous fact is due to inherent biological defects in the crowded life of cities'.  The word 'ominous' clearly means 'threatening' because the final stage of 'Each civilization' is 'decay', which is negative and an unfortunate reality as described by the passage-writer."

        explanation: "The correct answer is: 'C) The need for closer proximity to manufacturing and business centres is increasing'.  The clear reason why is that the passage is about the need for closer proximity of cities to manufacturing and business centres actually decreasing, not increasing.  Hence, C is the correct answer."

        correctAnswer: 0,
        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionA_PassageII.png",
        explanation: "The sentence in discussion is: '<b>Apart from</b> the care of children and periods of sheer rest, the active lives were spent in the cities'.  An effective strategy for this problem type is literally replacing the phrase 'Apart from' with the other phrases and see what makes sense.

        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionB_21-30.png",
        explanation: "The correct answer is: 'D) transmitter'.  The correct phrase is 'radio transmitter'.  The other answer choices don't make sense in the context of the phrase and sentence.  A 'transmitter' is more likely to be hidden than a 'speaker' as it seems like extraneous information if it is being shared in the passage that a 'radio speaker' was hidden at 'Whibley's flat'."

        correctAnswer: 1,
        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionB_21-30.png",
        explanation: "Logically, an object like a 'radio transmitter' wouldn't be hidden 'on' a piano.  Grammatically, a 'radio transmitter' wouldn't be hidden 'at' or 'across' a piano as both sound odd.  Hence, the correct answer is: 'B) inside'.  Hiding something 'inside a piano' makes logical and grammatical sense which is why B is the correct answer."

        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionB_21-30.png",
        explanation: "The correct answer is: 'C) arrested'.  The correct sentence is as follows: 'After Whibley was arrested, he confessed that he had been receiving large sums of money from the Iranian Embassy to obtain official secrets'.  The phrase 'was arrested' is grammatically correct here and is the correct answer choice."

        image: "img/JAMB4_Comprehension_SectionB_31-40.png",
        explanation: "The fact that the verb could be 'improve' or 'improving' makes this question a bit more challenging.  However, when looking closely at the phrase 'has his heart set on', it becomes clear that this is a true focus and dedication that is synonymous with the phrase 'is determined to'.  The correct sentence would read: 'The newly appointed manager is determined to improve the company's business.'."

        explanation: "The correct answer for this question is: 'B) from different professions and backgrounds'.  The reason is that the phrase 'all walks of life' emphasizes the different journeys that people may take with regards to work background, demographic background, class background, etc. and not necessarily different countries exclusively, which makes 'A) from different countries' incorrect."

        explanation: "The correct answer is: 'A) desires'.  The main reason is that craving for something from someone doesn't imply a demand; rather, it implies a heavy want.  Hence, the correct sentence would read: 'The offensive servant desires her master's pardon'."

        explanation: "The correct sentence is: 'No matter how strict a country’s law is, we must still maintain fairness between justice and mercy'.  This one is tricky because 'B) compromised' looks like it may be correct; however, upon further review, one may notice that you can't 'compromised' between justice and mercy as the tense makes it grammatically-incorrect.  The option choices C and D also don't make grammatical or logical sense.  Therefore, the correct answer is: 'A) maintain fairness'."

        explanation: "This phrase 'rest assured' (sometimes incorrectly written or spoken as 'be rest assured') can be replaced with 'be confident' and it'll make sense.  While 'A) be hopeful' looks like that it may be the correct answer, the word 'assured' should give a solid hint that there is some sense of certainty, which is why 'B) be confident' is correct instead of the less certain phrase 'be hopeful'."

While 'C) patiently' might seem correct, the emphasis of the phrase 'at breakneck speed' is not how the driver thinks about his/her choice to drive (like 'patiently' or 'discreetly' or 'excitedly', etc.), but is rather more of a descriptive adverb.
